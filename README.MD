# ☕ Java Learning Journey – Beginner to Pro

Welcome to my **Java Learning Repository**!
This repo contains everything I’ve learned while revising and polishing Java for **DSA**, **Web Development**, and **Mobile Development**.
Each chapter is well-documented with explanations, examples, and practice sets.

## 🎯 Next Steps

Once you finish these chapters, you can move to:

* **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** → Arrays, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Recursion, Sorting, Searching, Graphs, Dynamic Programming
* **Web Development** → Spring Boot, REST APIs, JPA/Hibernate, Databases (MySQL/MongoDB), Build Projects (Blog, E-commerce, Booking System)
* **Mobile Development** → Android Development (Java & later Kotlin), Activities, Fragments, UI, Build Apps (ToDo, Weather, Chat App)
